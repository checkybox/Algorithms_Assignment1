# Design and Analysis of Algorithms Assignment 1

## Learning goals
- Implement classic divide-and-conquer algorithms with safe recursion patterns
- Analyze running-time recurrences using Master Theorem (3 cases) and Akraâ€“Bazzi intuition; validate
with measurements.
- Collect metrics (time, recursion depth, comparisons/allocations) and communicate results via a short
report and clean Git history.

## Featured algorithms
- MergeSort (linear merge, buffer reuse, small-n cutoff to insertion sort)
- QuickSort (randomized pivot, bounded recursion depth)
- Deterministic Select (Median of Medians)
- Closest Pair of Points in 2D
